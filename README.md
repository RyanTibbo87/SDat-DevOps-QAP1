# SDat-DevOps-QAP1 - Ryan Tibbo

## 1. Explain how your code meets clean code practices

This example is from the test file and shows the list of games available to purchase and how its quite easy to follow/read

<br />
Next I'd like to talk about the case sequence for when people would like add games to their cart, or how it handles errors of the games not available  and to view what they currently have in their cart.

<br />
This allows people to not only make purchases and view what games are available but also handles errors in case there are games that are no longer available or that we do not sell.
<br />
Lastly I would like to show the menu of games and how to operate the game store system

<br />
This is just clean to operate and clean to look at
<br />


## 2. Explain your project

The Game Store System is a command-line Java application that allows users to browse a catalog of games, add games to a cart, and purchase them.

## 3. Outline the needed dependencies

The only needed dependencies was JUnit 5

## 4. Any Problems with the QAP

I had a few issues uploading it to github where my commits wouldn't sync and I was afraid to lose my commits but I figured it out after a while by logging out and logging back in on VSC. I also had some issues trying to add the dependencies but I used chatGPT to help me with the xml file. Overall I enjoyed the experience of doing this project, I also used popular games from Steam as my basis for prices and games.
